assistant uses [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/), [Skeleton 2.0.4](http://getskeleton.com/) and a Makise Kurisu .gif from [Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds](http://5pb.jp/games/pbbg/en/character_4.html).

Most of the algorithms used (including the diagrams) are from [Bob Burton's cubewhiz.com](http://www.cubewhiz.com/). There were a few that were swapped out/rotated at some point; unfortunately I don't remember when or where they came from.
